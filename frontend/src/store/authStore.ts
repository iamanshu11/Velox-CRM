/**
 * Auth state for the SPA.
 *
 * The actual session token now lives in an httpOnly cookie set by the
 * backend on login (see authController.AUTH_COOKIE_NAME). JavaScript can
 * neither read nor write that cookie, so the token is no longer exposed
 * to XSS attacks. We only persist the user *profile* here so that the
 * UI can render the right chrome (name, role, sidebar) on hard reload
 * without an extra round-trip; AuthProvider re-validates the session via
 * GET /api/auth/me on mount and clears the user if the cookie has expired.
